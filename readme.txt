== Description ==

Add shortcodes to your posts and pages to include a product listed on AliExpress. Enriched with image, title, actual price and option to directly order on AliExpress for your visitors.

The shortcode can be used in two ways:

1. Use [aliexpress id="123456"] where the ID is an AliExpress item ID which can be found in the URL.
2. Use [aliexpress url="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/This-is-an-item/123456.html"] where the URL is a direct link to an AliExpress item.

Optionally it is possible to setup your own API key and tracking ID for AliExpress to generate income as an AliExpress affiliate from your blog posts.
